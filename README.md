# Web-Spell-Checker-Implementation-of-Array-Algorithms-and-Spell-Checking-Functionality

• Implemented array algorithms, including mergesort, for a web page spell checker Utilized the SortUtils class with a comparator to implement mergesort, merge, mergeSortKeep, and mergeSortMove methods
• Successfully sorted array segments and merged two sorted segments into a single array using explicit temporary areas
• Implemented set difference (A−B) algorithm to remove elements from one sorted segment that occur in another sorted segment
• Developed the uniq method to remove duplicate elements from a sorted array segment
• Worked on the spell-checker functionality by downloading web pages, extracting words from XML elements, and comparing
them against a dictionary of words
• Handled parsing of HTML and ignoring element names and attributes, focusing only on strings inside element bodies
• Utilized the split method with a regular expression to break strings into words, excluding apostrophes from word breaking
• Completed the SortUtils and SpellCheck classes, ensuring the proper functioning of the implemented methods
• Optional task: Identified a misspelled word on an official UWM web page and reported it on Piazza for fun (no points)
